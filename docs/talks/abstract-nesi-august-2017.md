## Abstract 

Stencila aims to bridge a gap between coders and non-coders. Many research
projects require a collaboration between people with technical data science
skills, and domain expertise. Born out of frustration coordinating on the
production of research articles, Stencila provides a common interface
that is comfortable for everyone.

Researchers should expect that their analysis is reproducible, and that code
is available for review. The Stencila tools are designed to run and re-run
documents, making all analysis reproducible by default. Moreover, we have
discovered that reproducibility is the key ingredient to facilitating
collaboration.

The Stencila project began with New Zealand scientist Nokome Bentley wanting to
make it easy to collaborate on his own projects. Earlier this year Stencila was
identified by the US Sloan Foundation as deserving more support. With their help
Stencila is being actively developed by an international team lead by Nokome,
and including data scientist Finlay Thompson from Dragonfly.
